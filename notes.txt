Data normilization:
- Normilization is a process to make sure our data is sound and it is unlikely to create issues
- each record has a primary key
- no fields are repeated
- all fields relate directly to the key data
- Each field entry contains a single data point
- there are no redundant entries


Table relationships:

most common type of relationship = "one-to-many"
one-to-many:
- users to posts (one user can have many posts, but a single post only belongs to one user)
- foot to toes (one foot has many toes, but for each toe it only belongs to one foot)
WHEN WORKING WITH ONE-TO-MANY BE SURE TO KEEP IN MIND WHICH IS THE ONE AND WHICH IS THE MANY

many-to-many:
- bands to venues(one band will play at many different venues and each venue will host many different bands)
- Writers to magazines(one writer may publish in many different magazines, and each magazine will have many writers that contribute)

one-to-one:
- citizens to SSN's(each citizen will have exactly one SSN and each SSN issued only points back to one citizen)

TABLE RELATIONSHIPS IN SUMMARY: Figure out which piece of your data is the "one" and then discover the "many"
